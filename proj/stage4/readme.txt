The Dataset is in the  PWM_Thrust_dataset.csv file. 
Column#1 has the PWM from Motor1
Column#2 has the PWM from Motor2
Column#3 has the PWM from Motor3
Column#4 has the PWM from Motor4
Column#5 has the Thrust data from z-axis Accelerometer

to run the program give the command line below:

python project.py 'PWM_Thrust_dataset.csv'
